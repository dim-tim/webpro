This is a skeleton project for a Java webapp.

It includes:
- Ant & Ivy for dependency management
- Jersey for handling of http requests in a RESTful way
- Spring for dependency injection in the code
- H2 database (Windows users may need to edit jetty-web.xml)
- Liquibase for DB migration
- Hibernate for working with the DB
- JUnit & Mockito for unit testing

After cloning, run src/Launcher.java to start. Everything is preconfigured.
